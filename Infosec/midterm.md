#### A. Communication is in what layer?
- Data link layer(2) 
	- **mac address**
	- **ethernet protocol**
 
- **ARP**
	- Find device with a MAC address by broadcasting the IP address
 
- Network layer(3)
	- **IP - outline**
	- **p.36,37 , port, address**
		- source address, destination address (4-byte)

- Transport layer(4)
	- Port number (TCP's address)
	- **TCP/IP(pg.59~)**

- Application layer(7)
	- **DNS, HTTP**
	- **wireshark - how to use, what it does**

**pg.81 - flow of packets through network**

# 3
**DNS, (learn host file for DNS)**
- host file
	- IP_address domain_name
	- Mostly empty
- linux 
	- /etc/resolv.conf
- A record
skip ip tracing
skip dark web
skip malware (악성코드)

# 4
**HTTP protocol (with burp)**
**header, cookie**
**how login works**
**session hijacking**
- **base64**
	- Most used encoding method
ascii
encoding, decoding

# 5(main!!)
**hexdump**
- **classic cryptography**
	- Caesar cipher
		- shift
	- Vigenere
		- Caesar + key
- **XOR**
	- no need of Carry
pngransome practice

# 6
hashing in cryptography
skip crc algorithm(just understand what CRC is)

# 7
**All!**
Asymmetric cryptography
