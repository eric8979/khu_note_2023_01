### Boolean Algebra
- Closure
	- for all a, b ∈ N, if a * b = c and c ∈ N
	- N is **closed** with the operation.
- Identity element
	- for all x ∈ S, e * x = x * e = x
	- e is identity element.
	- e.g. 1 in multiplication, 0 in summation
- Inverse
	- for x, y ∈ S  if x * y = e
- Distributive law
	- x * ( y + z ) = x * y + x * z
