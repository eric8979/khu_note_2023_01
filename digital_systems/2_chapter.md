### Boolean Algebra
- Closure
	- for all a, b ∈ N, if a * b = c and c ∈ N
	- N is **closed** with * operation.
- Associative law
	- (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) 
	- for all x, y, z in S
- Communtative law
	- x * y = y * x
	- for all x, y in S
- Identity element
	- for all x ∈ S, e * x = x * e = x
	- e is identity element.
	- e.g. 1 in multiplication, 0 in summation
- Inverse
	- for x, y ∈ S  if x * y = e
- Distributive law
	- x * ( y + z ) = x * y + x * z
